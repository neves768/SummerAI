# SummerAI
Virtual Assistant AI with Speech Recognition


# Procedures to install dependencies

Requires Microsoft Visual C++ 14.0 Build Tools and Python 3.6.8 to support PyAudio on Windows

Steps
```sh
$ pip install pyaudio
$ pip install speechrecognition
```

Doublecheck if you are really using Python 3.6.x instead of the most recent version 3.8.x.
PyAudio is not working properly with newer versions.
